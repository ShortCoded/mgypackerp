=== .ai/project-workflow rules ===

# Extend the Existing ERP

- Treat MgyPack as an existing system. Before changing behavior, inspect the current implementation, its shared component or service, the closest working reference screen, and the relevant tests.
- Load the relevant project skill from `**/skills/**` whenever its description matches the work; mandatory project rules remain in these generated guidelines rather than only in optional skills.
- Preserve the established company, branch, financial-period, permission, translation, formatting, and soft-delete boundaries. Do not remove a scope or invent parallel domain behavior to make an isolated fix pass.
- Review Git status before editing and preserve unrelated uncommitted work. Keep changes focused, use the existing UI and architectural conventions, and verify every change with targeted tests.
- Use Laravel Boost documentation and inspection tools when they cover the question. Prefer database aggregates, scoped queries, and paginated lists over loading records into memory.

# Codex-led Local Delegation

- Codex owns diagnosis, task boundaries, worker selection, review, integration, and final verification. Delegated workers are bounded executors, not second leads, and must not delegate again.
- Codex should choose delegation automatically when it improves speed, context use, isolation, or cost. Use `scripts/ai/delegate-agent` as the normal entry point; it routes to the verified Hermes cheap or strong worker and may use OpenCode only when `scripts/ai/delegation.conf` enables it and its health probe passes.
- OpenCode is optional. Before enabling it, verify the installed CLI version, configuration, authenticated provider, permissions, and a safe repository-aware invocation. Its failure must fall back once to Hermes rather than aborting the user task.
- KiosAPI is disabled and non-blocking. It must not be loaded, probed, or used as an active delegation dependency unless a future user explicitly reopens that work.
- Every implementation delegation must state the concrete problem, expected behavior, allowed files or areas, existing patterns and invariants, acceptance criteria, and requested report of edits, tests actually run, and unverified items. Never include secrets or customer data.
- Start with one writer. Do not overlap writers on the same files. After each delegation, Codex must inspect the diff for scope drift and run the relevant tests on the integrated working tree. Tool completion or an agent claim is not proof of correctness.
- Resume the same writer session after review corrections when the runtime supports it. Start another writer only when new evidence, a distinct boundary, or an explicit tier escalation justifies it.
- Codex remains the T3 owner for accounting, inventory integrity, security privilege boundaries, migrations, concurrency, closing, reconciliation, and release gates. It may delegate bounded discovery, safe subparts, review, or QA, but retains architecture and GO / NO-GO responsibility.
- If one delegation target is unavailable or fails, follow `docs/ai/MODEL_ROUTING.md` fallback rules and continue safely; do not claim a worker wrote changes it did not produce.

# Local Agent Infrastructure v1

- Before delegating, the orchestrator must classify the task and follow `docs/ai/AGENT_OPERATING_MODEL.md`, `docs/ai/MODEL_ROUTING.md`, and `docs/ai/EXECUTION_BUDGETS.md`. Model routing is the orchestrator's deterministic responsibility; do not create a model-router agent.
- Use only the approved explorer, worker, deep_worker, reviewer, critical_reviewer, and qa roles. Keep one writer unless independent file boundaries are proven, and never let a subagent delegate again.
- Read the minimum relevant context. Start with `docs/erp/INDEX.md`, use `CODEX_PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` only for the historical sections it identifies, then pass concise evidence and file references forward so downstream agents do not repeat discovery.
- Critical financial, inventory, migration, security, concurrency, idempotency, and tenant-scope work is T3 regardless of apparent size and requires an independent critical review plus targeted regression or reconciliation evidence.
- Do not bypass an exhausted step budget by respawning the same role. A new invocation needs new evidence, narrower scope, an explicit tier escalation, or a distinct independent review purpose.
- Git pushes, production deployments, destructive database operations, and broad secret or environment-file access must never happen automatically.
- Local Qwen 27B is optional and manual only. Its current CPU latency is impractical for normal routing, so neither Codex nor OpenCode may auto-start it or use it as an automatic provider, role, or fallback.

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/octane (OCTANE) - v2
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- livewire/livewire (LIVEWIRE) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/breeze (BREEZE) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- laravel/telescope (TELESCOPE) - v5
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v3
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- alpinejs (ALPINEJS) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v3

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
  - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `pnpm run build` or ask the user to run `pnpm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app/Console/Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== octane/core rules ===

# Octane

- Octane boots the application once and reuses it across requests, so singletons persist between requests.
- The Laravel container's `scoped` method may be used as a safe alternative to `singleton`.
- Never inject the container, request, or config repository into a singleton's constructor; use a resolver closure or `bind()` instead:

```php
// Bad
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn (Application $app) => new Service($app['request']));

// Good
$this->app->singleton(Service::class, fn () => new Service(fn () => request()));
```

- Never append to static properties, as they accumulate in memory across requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- The `{name}` argument should not include the test suite directory. Use `php artisan make:test --pest SomeFeatureTest` instead of `php artisan make:test --pest Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
